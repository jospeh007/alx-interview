# 0. Change Comes from Within

This project tackles a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the **coin change problem**. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient.

## Key Concepts

### Greedy Algorithms
- **Understanding Greedy Algorithms**: Learn how greedy algorithms work and why they can be suitable for the coin change problem.
- **Limitations**: Recognize the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution.

### Dynamic Programming
- **Principles of Dynamic Programming**: Understand dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
- **Overlapping Subproblems & Optimal Substructure**: Explore these concepts in the context of the coin change problem.

### Algorithmic Complexity
- **Time and Space Complexity**: Analyze the complexity of algorithms and strive for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Breaking Down Problems**: Learn to break down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- **Iterative vs. Recursive Approaches**: Compare different approaches to dynamic programming.

### Python Programming
- **Manipulating Lists**: Use lists and list comprehensions effectively in Python.
- **Efficient Looping and Conditionals**: Implement functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.
